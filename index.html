            <p>This is text contained inside of a standard easily-stylable tag</p>  <!-- Q2) Because it is read from top to bottom and whatever is at the end will shown -->
            <p>Q3) .onload runs the JS script once the files have been loaded, it is good because it waits for the files in the script to load and therefor will not give error or will tell you something is missing.</p>
            <p>Q4) cityPop is a variabe that is storing different elements, in this case cities (a string) and population (an integer), its like a dictionary.</p>
